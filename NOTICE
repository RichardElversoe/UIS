UIS / UIS-Engine / UIS-Render — Naming and Attribution Clause
=============================================================

In addition to the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, the following terms apply:

1. Attribution:
   All forks, derivatives, or modified versions of UIS, UIS-Engine, or UIS-Render must retain
   clear attribution to the original authors in both the source code and documentation.
   This includes a notice of original authorship and a reference to the original project.

   Example attribution:
   > "Based on UIS (Universal Interface Script) created by Richard Elversøe and contributors."

2. Naming Distinction:
   Projects that significantly diverge from UIS, UIS-Engine, or UIS-Render—whether in functionality,
   direction, or purpose—must use a name that is clearly distinguishable from the original
   names to prevent confusion with the official project(s).

3. Upstream Compatibility:
   Community modifications and enhancements should, where reasonably possible, be made in a way that
   allows them to be submitted to and merged into the upstream (original) project. Contributions
   that deliberately break compatibility may still be made, but should be documented as such.

4. Use in Software:
   Applications, games, or other software created using UIS, UIS-Engine, or UIS-Render are not
   required to be open source or adopt this license. However, a credit line acknowledging use
   of UIS and referencing the original project must be included in user-facing documentation
   or in an “About” section of the application.
